Facebook Messenger client for Ruby.

gem 'facebook-messenger'
```

Or install it yourself as:

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
